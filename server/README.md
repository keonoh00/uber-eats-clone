# uber-eats-clone-server

This is a backend repository for Uber Eats Clone

Following [CodeFirst](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start#code-first) approach,
we will use [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/) to build GraphQL server.
Code first approach means that we will define GraphQL schema using TypeScript classes and generate GraphQL schema from them.

## TypeORM

We will use [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) to interact with database.
TypeORM allows us to use TypeScript to write SQL queries.
